        "In today's exercises, we will explore various optimization algorithms and their roles in training deep learning models. We will delve into the inner workings of different optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RMSprop, and Adam, and learn how to implement them using code. Additionally, we will discuss the concept of loss landscapes and their significance in visualizing the challenges faced during the optimization process. By the end of this set of exercises, you will have a solid understanding of optimization algorithms and their impact on model performance. We'll also take a look at Weights and Biases, a tool that can be used to track and visualize the training process, and test different values of hyperparameters to find the most effective ones.\n",

However you can still treat the first 2 sections as normal and then make this switch for the third section."

To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n",

Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.\n",

Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n",
        "\n",
        "At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n",

        "\n",
        "You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n",

It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs.

In other words, this should look just like your optimization loops in previous days' material, except rather than passing in `model.parameters()` to your optimizer, you pass in `(xy,)` (because it needs to be an iterable of parameters, not just a single parameter).\n",

        "\n",
        "From SGD, we'll move onto discussing **adaptive gradient descent methods**. These are methods which automatically adjust the learning rate of each parameter during training, based on the size of gradients at previous steps. In a sense this is similar to how momentum operates in SGD, but we don't tend to describe SGD plus momentum as an adaptive method. When discussing momentum, we usually think of the analogy of a ball rolling down a hill, and the ball's velocity accelerates until it reaches some terminal velocity. The momentum parameter $\\mu$ controls the terminal velocity: as $\\mu \\to 1$ the terminal velocity gets very high, which also means it can take a long time to adjust its speed when it enters new territory. In contrast, adaptive methods are better thought of as deliberate, conscious updates to the learning rate of parameters based on past values. They allow us to speed up when we need to, but without sacrificing our ability to adapt quickly when we enter new regimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first adaptive method we'll look at is **RMSprop**. This is actually the second main adaptive method that was proposed in the optimization literature, after AdaGrad (however the problem with AdaGrad is that it decays the learning rates too quickly - this is the problem that RMSprop solves). RMSprop is similar to SGD, with an added dynamic: **the size of parameter steps are scaled according to the variance of past gradients**, with higher variance leading to smaller steps. Intuitively, if you're in a very monotonic region of the loss landscape then you want to take larger steps (since you know where you're going and you just want to get there quickly), whereas if you're in a very noisy region and possibly oscillating around minima then you want to take smaller steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "One final note - when we're using non-adaptive methods like SGD we tend to have an inverse relationship between the learning rate and the batch size. Broadly speaking, this is because a larger batch size means our gradients will have smaller variance, and so we can safely use a larger learning rate. This generally isn't necessary for adaptive methods since the learning rates will be adjusted automatically during training based on the variance of our gradients - we don't need to manually scale them ourselves. Most commonly during optimization, we'll start with the default hyperparameters for whatever adaptive optimizer we're using, and then adjust from there."

        "There's an important clarification to make here - the first order adjustment of Adam is sometimes called momentum as a shorthand, but there's an important sense in which it isn't. The key difference is that SGD's momentum causes acceleration until we hit terminal velocity, which could be very large for $\\mu \\approx 1$. In contrast, Adam's momentum is an exponentially weighted moving average - the parameter $\\beta_1$ controls how quickly it adjusts (with a value closer to 1 meaning it adjust to newer values more slowly), but it doesn't change the terminal velocity in any sense. Mathematically, the difference between these two is minimal (all you'd need to do is take Adam's update rule $m_t \\leftarrow \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\\beta_1) g_t$ and change it to $m_t \\leftarrow \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + g_t$ for it to have the same qualitative behaviour as SGD), but this extra factor makes a lot of difference!"

This is a very small modification of the Adam update rule, where we apply weight decay in a different way (by modifying the weights $theta_t$ themselves, rather than modifying the gradients $g_t$ and then using those modified gradients in the first & second moment calculations). This means that, unlike with Adam, using weight decay is equivalent to having a Gaussian prior on the weights with mean zero (or alternatively, equivalent to L2 regularization). This is seen as the more \"correct\" way to implement weight decay, and so AdamW is now generally preferred over Adam.\n",

For another, momentum causes RMSprop step sizes to increase in an unstable way, which is why it will overshoot the minima and get stuck on the other side without careful hyperparameter tuning.

        "Next, Rosenbrock's banana. This function has a global minimum at `(1, 1)` inside a long, narrow, parabolic-shaped valley. Basic gradient descent often zigzags back and forth along the valley, making very slow progress. Momentum is absolutely essential to perform well in this task. This is a rare case where SGD plus momentum does converge faster than Adam because the higher terminal velocity enables larger step sizes plus the extreme slope of the loss landscape prevents the kind of instability that usually hinders SGD. However, some caveats: SGD requires a very small step size to prevent unstable oscillations (given how steep the valley is), whereas Adam is much more stable. Furthermore, if we extend the number of iterations, we see that Adam does also converge, and it does so with fewer oscillations than SGD (it stays within the parabolic valley).\n",

        "\n",
        "One important skill which every aspiring ML researcher should develop is the ability to play around with hyperparameters and improve a model's training. At times this is more of an art than a science, because frequently rules and heuristics which work most of the time will break down in certain special cases. For example, a common heuristic for number of workers in a `DataLoader` is to set them to be 4 times the number of GPUs you have available (see later sections on distributed computing for more on this). However, setting these values too high can lead to issues where your CPU is bottlenecked by the workers and your epochs take a long time to start - it took me a long time to realize this was happening when I was initially writing these exercises!\n",
        "\n",
        "Sweeping over hyperparameters (which we'll cover shortly) can help remove some of the difficulty here, because you can use sweep methods that guide you towards an optimal set of hyperparameter choices rather than having to manually pick your own. However, here are a few heuristics that you might find useful in a variety of situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Setting batch size**\n",
        "    - Generally you should aim to **saturate your GPU** with data - this means choosing a batch size that's as large as possible without causing memory errors\n",
        "        - You should generally aim for over 70% utilization of your GPU\n",
        "    - Note, this means you should generally try for a larger batch size in your testloader than your trainloader (because evaluation is done without gradients, and so a smaller memory constraint)\n",
        "        - A good starting point is 4x the size, but this will vary between models\n",
        "- **Choosing a learning rate**\n",
        "    - Inspecting loss curves can be a good way of evaluating our learning rate\n",
        "        - If loss is decreasing very slowly & monotonically then this is a sign you should increase the learning rate, whereas very large loss spikes are a sign that you should decrease it\n",
        "    - A common strategy is **warmup**, i.e. having a smaller learning rate for a short period of time at the start of training - we'll do this a lot in later material\n",
        "    - [Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/) has a good blog post on learning rates\n",
        "- **Balancing learning rate and batch size**\n",
        "    - For standard optimizers like `SGD`, it's a good idea to scale the learning rate inversely to the batch size - this way the variance of each parameter step remains the same\n",
        "    - However for **adaptive optimizers** such as `Adam` (where the size of parameter updates automatically adjusts based on the first and second moments of our gradients), this isn't as necessary\n",
        "        - This is why we generally start with default parameters for Adam, and then adjust from there\n",
        "- **Misc. advice**\n",
        "    - If you're training a larger model, it's sometimes a good idea to start with a smaller version of that same model. Good hyperparameters tend to transfer if the architecture & data is the same; the main difference is the larger model may require more regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
        "    - Bad hyperparameters are usually clearly worse by the end of the first 1-2 epochs. You can manually abort runs that don't look promising (or do it automatically - see discussion of Hyperband in wandb sweeps at the end of this section)\n",

        "\n",
        "One way to search for good hyperparameters is to choose a set of values for each hyperparameter, and then search all combinations of those specific values. This is called **grid search**. The values don't need to be evenly spaced and you can incorporate any knowledge you have about plausible values from similar problems to choose the set of values. Searching the product of sets takes exponential time, so is really only feasible if there are a small number of hyperparameters. I would recommend forgetting about grid search if you have more than 3 hyperparameters, which in deep learning is \"always\".\n",
        "\n",
        "A much better idea is for each hyperparameter, decide on a sampling distribution and then on each trial just sample a random value from that distribution. This is called **random search** and back in 2012, you could get a [publication](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) for this. The diagram below shows the main reason that random search outperforms grid search. Empirically, some hyperparameters matter more than others, and random search benefits from having tried more distinct values in the important dimensions, increasing the chances of finding a \"peak\" between the grid points.\n",

        "It's worth noting that both of these searches are vastly less efficient than gradient descent at finding optima - imagine if you could only train neural networks by randomly initializing them and checking the loss! Either of these search methods without a dose of human (or eventually AI) judgement is just a great way to turn electricity into a bunch of models that don't perform very well."

        "Now we've come to one of the most impressive features of `wandb` - being able to perform hyperparameter sweeps. We do this by defining a `sweep_config` dict which tells us how our hyperparameters will be randomly sampled, then we write a `train` function which takes no arguments and launches a training run with our modified hyperparameters. Lastly we use `wandb.sweep` and `wandb.agent` to run our sweep. We'll go through each step of this below."

While distributed training can be used for any type of ML model training, it is most beneficial to use it for large models and compute demanding tasks as deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 2 main families of distributed training methods: **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**. In data parallelism, we split batches of data across different processes, run forward & backward passes on each separately, and accumulate the gradients to update the model parameters. In model parallelism, the model is segmented into different parts that can run concurrently in different nodes, and each one runs on the same data. Model parallelism further splits into horizontal and vertical parallelism depending on whether we're splitting the model up into sequential or parallel parts. Most often horizontal parallelism is called **tensor parallelism** (because it involves splitting up the weights in a single layer across multiple GPUs, into what we commonly call **sharded weights**), and vertical parallelism is called **pipeline parallelism**.\n",

However it is possible to create hybrid forms of parallelism by combining these; this is especially common when training large models like current SOTA LLMs. In these exercises, we'll focus on just data parallelism, although we'll suggest a few bonus exercises that explore model parallelism."

        "We recommend filtering for \"Disk Space To Allocate\" (i.e. the primary slider on the top of the filter menu) of at least 40GB, not for the model (which is actually quite small) but for installing the ARENA dependencies. You should also filter for number of GPUs: we recommend 4x or 8x. You can do this using the options menu at the very top of the list of machines. Lastly, we recommend filtering for a decent PCIE Bandwidth (e.g. at least 20GB/s) - this is important for efficient gradient sychronization between GPUs. We're training a small model today: approx 22m parameters, which translates to ~88MB total size of weights, and so we'll transfer 88MB of data between GPUs per process (since we're transferring the model's gradients, which have the same size as the weights). We don't want this to be a bottleneck, which is why we should filter for this bandwidth.\n",

        "The data in the example below is the same as the rank index, i.e. `r = 0, 1`. For initial parameter `x = 2` this gives us errors of `(x-r).pow(2) = 4, 2` respectively, and gradients of `2x(x-r) = 8, 4`. Averaging these gives us a gradient of `6`, so after a single optimization step with learning rate `lr=0.1` we get our gradients changing to `2.0 - 0.6 = 1.4`."

        "We'll now use everything we've learned to put together a full training loop! Rather than finetuning it which we've been doing so far, you'll be training your resnet from scratch (although still using the same CIFAR10 dataset). We've given you a function `get_untrained_resnet` which uses the `ResNet34` class from yesterday's solutions, although you're encouraged to replace this function with your implementation if you've completed those exercises.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Weight broadcasting at initialization**\n",
        "    - For each process you'll need to initialize your model and move it onto the corresponding GPU, but you also want to make sure each process is working with the same model. You do this by **broadcasting weights in the `__init__` method**, e.g. using process 0 as the shared source process.\n",
        "    - Note - you may find you'll have to brodcast `param.data` rather than `param` when you iterate through the model's parameters, because broadcasting only works for tensors not parameters. Parameters are a special class wrapping around and extending standard PyTorch tensors - we'll look at this in more detail tomorrow!\n",
        "2. **Dataloader sampling at each epoch**\n",
        "    - Distributed training works by splitting each batch of data across all the running processes, and so we need to implement this by splitting each batch randomly across our GPUs.\n",
        "    - Some sample code for this is given below - we recommend you start with this (although you're welcome to play around with some of the parameters here like `num_workers` and `pin_memory`).\n",
        "3. **Parameter syncing after each training step**\n",
        "    - After each `loss.backward()` call but before stepping with the optimizer, you'll need to use `all_reduce` to sync gradients across each parameter in the model.\n",
        "    - Just like in the example we gave above, calling `all_reduce` on `param.grad` should work, because `.grad` is a standard PyTorch tensor.\n",
        "4. **Aggregating correct predictions after each evaluation step**\\*\n",
        "    - We can also split the evaluation step across GPUs - we use `all_reduce` at the end of the `evaluate` method to sum the total number of correct predictions across GPUs.\n",

These kinds of logs are generally very helpful for debugging slow code.\n",
        "- Since running this code won't directly return your model as output, it's good practice to save your model at the end of training using `torch.save`.\n",
        "- We recommend you increment `examples_seen` by the total number of examples across processes, i.e. `len(input) * world_size`. This will help when you're comparing across different runs with different world sizes (it's convenient for them to have a consistent x-axis)."

Broadly speaking, ring-based algorithms work by sending data in a cyclic pattern (i.e. worker `n` sends it to worker `n+1 % N` where `N` is the total number of workers). After each sending round, we perform a reduction operation to the data that was just sent.

This highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning for measuring scaling law exponents.\n",
